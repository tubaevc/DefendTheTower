# 2D Tower Defense project
Core Mechanics:

Players can place towers on predefined spots within their budget.
Towers can be upgraded to stronger versions, consuming additional budget.
Each tower has a specific cost. Placing or upgrading towers deducts from the player's budget.
The player earns coins by defeating enemies, which can be used to purchase or upgrade towers.
Enemies spawn in waves, with each wave progressively increasing in difficulty.
Enemies utilize Unity’s 2D NavMesh system to navigate towards their target.
Enemies have health points (HP) that decrease when hit by towers.
